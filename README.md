This repository contains a Kaggle challenge, in which house prices should be predicted given a set of variables.

It mainly serves the purpose of getting familiar with Python, pandas and basic machine learning / regression techniques and practicing feature engineering to improve the model's prediction accuracy.

Please feel free to comment on my code. All help is very welcome as I'm trying to get more and more involved in my just started Data Science Journey.
