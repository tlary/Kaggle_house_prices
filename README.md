This repository contains code to a Kaggle challenge, in which house prices should be predicted given a set of variables.
(link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

It mainly serves the purpose of getting familiar with Python, pandas and basic machine learning / regression techniques and practicing feature engineering to improve the model's prediction accuracy.

Please feel free to comment on my code since this is my first Kaggle challenge / data science project. All help is very welcome as I'm trying to get more and more involved in my just started Data Science Journey.


Things to try:
  - use regularization before training the model (Lasso, Ridge); alternative: try wrapper rfcv()
  - log(x+1) transform the numerical data in order to get them closer to normal distribution
